Description
A savory slow-cooked stew for Shabbat with meat, potatoes, and beans. Also known as chamin, dafina, or skhina.

Ingredients
2 1/2 lbs large red potatoes, peeled and halved (for a smaller slow cooker, use 2 lbs)
2 whole onions, chopped
2 1/2 lbs beef stew meat or brisket, cut into chunks (for a smaller slow cooker, use 2 lbs)
2 marrow bones
1 cup dried beans - lima, pinto, chickpeas, red beans (not kidney), or a mixture
1/2 cup pearl barley or coarse-grain kasha (optional - for gluten free, do not use pearl barley)
3 whole garlic cloves
6 eggs (optional)
1/2 tsp black pepper (if spice sensitive use 1/4 tsp)
1 quart low sodium chicken broth
1 tbsp kosher salt
1 1/2 tsp paprika
1 1/2 tsp turmeric
1 tsp cumin
1/4 tsp cayenne (if spice sensitive use just a pinch)
1 kishke (optional - we never add this, but many families like it)
Water (varies)

Instructions
1. Note: The beans in this recipe will soften without any pre-soaking due to the long slow cooking process, however they will be easier to digest with a simple quick soak prior to cooking. To do this, place the beans into the bottom of a large pot and cover with water. The beans will expand to over double their size, so make sure you cover by several inches of water to allow for expansion. Bring the beans to a boil for 5 minutes, then remove from heat. Let them soak in the cooking water for 1 hour, then drain and rinse well before proceeding with the recipe. Also note that it is not recommended to slow-cook kidney beans.
2. In a large slow cooker (the larger the better!), place the potatoes in a single layer on the bottom of the cooking vessel.
